One is that we are a very elastic institution. If a Scout Leader does not like the aims of the Movement, he is perfectly at liberty to go and play somewhere else.

I cannot commend that spirit too highly, because it is the essential of success in a Movement like ours. 童軍運動有兩個特性：第一，它是一種很有彈性的組織，如果你不喜歡童軍運動的訓練及目 標，你大可自由離去。第二點是「四海之內皆兄弟」的精神，這種精神才是最重要的，因它才 是童軍運動成功的關鍵所在。 PROGRESSIVE BADGES | 21 SCOUT PATHFINDER AWARDPROGRESSIVE BADGESD.",
